## Description

This project aims to create a versatile home security system utilizing the ESP32 microcontroller, coupled with a buzzer, motion sensor, and DHT11 temperature sensor. The system is designed to be remotely controlled and monitored via Telegram bot integration.

## Key Features

**Remote Control:** Users can remotely activate, deactivate, and set the alarm status through commands sent via a Telegram bot interface.<br>
**Motion Detection:** The motion sensor detects any movement within its range. When triggered, it activates the alarm and sends a notification to the user via Telegram.<br>
**Temperature Monitoring:** The DHT11 sensor measures the temperature of the environment, allowing users to monitor temperature fluctuations remotely through the Telegram bot.

## Components

**ESP32 Microcontroller:** Acts as the main control unit, facilitating communication between sensors and the Telegram bot.<br>
**Buzzer:** Emits alarm sounds when triggered by motion detection.<br>
**HC-SR501 Motion Sensor PIR:** Detects movement and triggers the alarm system.<br>
**DHT11 Temperature Sensor:** Monitors ambient temperature for remote temperature tracking.
